Given an integer array A of size N. Return 1 if the array can be arranged to form an arithmetic progression, otherwise return 0.

A sequence of numbers is called an arithmetic progression if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same.

Code:

class Solution:
    # @param A : list of integers
    # @return an integer
    def solve(self, A):
        A.sort()
        diff = A[1]-A[0]
        for i in range(2,len(A)):
            if diff!=A[i]-A[i-1]:
                return 0

        return 1
