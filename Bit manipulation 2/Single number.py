Given an array of integers A, every element appears twice except for one. Find that integer that occurs once.

NOTE: Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

class Solution:
    # @param A : tuple of integers
    # @return an integer
    def singleNumber(self, A):
        ans = 0
        for i in range(len(A)):
            ans = ans^A[i]
        return ans
