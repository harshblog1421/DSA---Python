Given an integer array A containing N distinct integers, you have to find all the leaders in array A. An element is a leader if it is strictly greater than all the elements to its right side.

NOTE: The rightmost element is always a leader.

Code:
class Solution:
    # @param A : list of integers
    # @return a list of integers
    def solve(self, A):
        max_value = A[-1]
        leaders  = [A[-1]]
        for i in range(len(A)-2,-1,-1):
            if A[i]>max_value:
                max_value = A[i]
                leaders.append(max_value)


        return leaders
