Given an integer A, you need to find the count of it's factors.

Factor of a number is the number which divides it perfectly leaving no remainder.

Example : 1, 2, 3, 6 are factors of 6

Code :
class Solution:
    # @param A : integer
    # @return an integer
    def solve(self, A):
        i = 1
        count = 0
        while i*i<=A:
            if A%i==0:
                count+=1
                if i!=A/i:
                    count+=1
            i+=1
        return count
