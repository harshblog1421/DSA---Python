You are given an integer A. You have to tell whether it is a perfect number or not.

Perfect number is a positive integer which is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors.

A proper divisor of a natural number is the divisor that is strictly less than the number.


Code:

class Solution:
    # @param A : integer
    # @return an integer
    def solve(self, A):
        sum = 0
        for i in range(1,A):
            if A%i==0:
                sum+=i
        if sum == A:
            return 1
        else:
            return 0
