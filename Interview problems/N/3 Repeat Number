You're given a read-only array of N integers. Find out if any integer occurs more than N/3 times in the array in linear time and constant additional space.
If so, return the integer. If not, return -1.

If there are multiple solutions, return any one.

Note: Read-only array means that the input array should not be modified in the process of solving the problem

Code:
class Solution:
    # @param A : tuple of integers
    # @return an integer
    def repeatedNumber(self, A):
        n = len(A)
    
        if n==0:
            return -1

        if n==1:
            return A[0]

        first = A[0]
        second = A[1]
        count1 = 1
        count2 = 1
        for i in range(2,n):
            if A[i]== first:
                count1 +=1

            elif A[i]==second:
                count2+=1
                
            elif count1==0:
                first = A[i]
                count1=1

            elif count2==0:
                second = A[i]
                count2=1

            else:
                count1-=1
                count2-=1

        for i in range(len(A)):
                if A[i]==first:
                    count1+=1
                elif A[i]==second:
                    count2+=1

        if count1 >n//3:
            return first
        elif count2>n//3:
            return second
        return -1
