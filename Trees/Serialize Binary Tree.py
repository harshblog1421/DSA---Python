Given the root node of a Binary Tree denoted by A. You have to Serialize the given Binary Tree in the described format.
Serialize means encode it into a integer array denoting the Level Order Traversal of the given Binary Tree.
NOTE:
In the array, the NULL/None child is denoted by -1.
For more clarification check the Example Input.

Problem Constraints
1 <= number of nodes <= 105

Input Format
Only argument is a A denoting the root node of a Binary Tree.

Output Format
Return an integer array denoting the Level Order Traversal of the given Binary Tree.

Example Input

Input 1:

           1
         /   \
        2     3
       / \
      4   5
Input 2:

            1
          /   \
         2     3
        / \     \
       4   5     6


Example Output

Output 1:

 [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1]
Output 2:

 [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, -1, 6, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1]


Example Explanation

Explanation 1:

 The Level Order Traversal of the given tree will be [1, 2, 3, 4, 5 , -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1].
 Since 3, 4 and 5 each has both NULL child we had represented that using -1.
Explanation 2:

 The Level Order Traversal of the given tree will be [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, -1, 6, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1].
 Since 3 has left child as NULL while 4 and 5 each has both NULL child.





from collections import deque
# Definition for a  binary tree node
# class TreeNode:
#    def __init__(self, x):
#        self.val = x
#        self.left = None
#        self.right = None

class Solution:
    # @param A : root node of tree
    # @return a list of integers
    def solve(self, A):
        
        dq = deque()
        dq.append(A)
        result = []
        while len(dq)>0:
            x = dq.popleft()

            if x is not None:
                result.append(x.val)
                dq.append(x.left)
                dq.append(x.right)

            else:
                result.append(-1)

        return result
