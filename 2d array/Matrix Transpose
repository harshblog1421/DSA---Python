Given a 2D integer array A, return the transpose of A.

The transpose of a matrix is the matrix flipped over its main diagonal, switching the matrix's row and column indices.

Code:

class Solution:
    # @param A : list of list of integers
    # @return a list of list of integers
    def solve(self, A):
       
        m = len(A)
        n = len(A[0])
        transposed = [[0]*m for _ in range(n)]
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                transposed[j][i] = A[i][j]
        return transposed
