You are given a N X N integer matrix. You have to find the sum of all the minor diagonal elements of A.

Minor diagonal of a M X M matrix A is a collection of elements A[i, j] such that i + j = M + 1 (where i, j are 1-based).

Code:
class Solution:
    # @param A : tuple of list of integers
    # @return an integer
    def solve(self, A):
        N = len(A)
        i = 0
        j = N-1
        sum1 = 0
        while i <N and j>=0:
            sum1+=A[i][j]
            i+=1
            j-=1
        return sum1
