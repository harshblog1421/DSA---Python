You are given two matrices A & B of same size, you have to return another matrix which is the sum of A and B.
Note: Matrices are of same size means the number of rows and number of columns of both matrices are equal.

Code:

class Solution:
    # @param A : list of list of integers
    # @param B : list of list of integers
    # @return a list of list of integers
    def solve(self, A, B):
        N = len(A)
        M = len(A[0])
        C = [[0]*M for _ in range(N)]

        for i in range(len(A)):
            for j in range(len(A[i])):
                C[i][j] = A[i][j] +B[i][j]
        return C
