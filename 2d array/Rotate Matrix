You are given a n x n 2D matrix A representing an image.
Rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).
You need to do this in place.
Note: If you end up using an additional array, you will only receive partial score.

Code:
class Solution:
    # @param A : list of list of integers
    def solve(self, A):
        m = len(A[0])
        n = len(A)
        transposed = [[0]*n for i in range(m)]
        
        for i in range(len(A)):
            for j in range(len(A[i])):
                transposed[j][i]= A[i][j]

        for i in range(len(transposed)):
            for j in range(len(transposed[i])//2):
                A[i][j], A[i][n-1-j]=A[i][n-1-j],A[i][j]

        return transposed
