Given the array of strings A, you need to find the longest string S, which is the prefix of ALL the strings in the array.


The longest common prefix for a pair of strings S1 and S2 is the longest string S which is the prefix of both S1 and S2.

Example: the longest common prefix of "abcdefgh" and "abcefgh" is "abc".

Code:
class Solution:
    # @param A : list of strings
    # @return a strings
    def longestCommonPrefix(self, A):
        if not A:
            return ""
            
        prefix = A[0]
        for i in range(len(A)):
            while not A[i].startswith(prefix):
                prefix = prefix[:-1]
                if not prefix:
                    return ""

        return prefix
