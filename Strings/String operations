Akash likes playing with strings. One day he thought of applying following operations on the string in the given order:

Concatenate the string with itself.
Delete all the uppercase letters.
Replace each vowel with '#'.
You are given a string A of size N consisting of lowercase and uppercase alphabets. Return the resultant string after applying the above operations.

NOTE: 'a' , 'e' , 'i' , 'o' , 'u' are defined as vowels.

Code:
class Solution:
    # @param A : string
    # @return a strings
    def solve(self, A):
        
        B = A+A

        C = []

        for i in range(len(B)):
            if ord(B[i])>=65 and ord(B[i])<=90:
                pass

            elif B[i] in ("a",'e','i','o','u'):
                C.append("#")

            elif ord(B[i])>=97 and ord(B[i])<=122:
                C.append(B[i])

        return ''.join(C)
