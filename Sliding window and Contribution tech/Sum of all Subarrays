You are given an integer array A of length N.
You have to find the sum of all subarray sums of A.
More formally, a subarray is defined as a contiguous part of an array which we can obtain by deleting zero or more elements from either end of the array.
A subarray sum denotes the sum of all the elements of that subarray.

Note : Be careful of integer overflow issues while calculations. Use appropriate datatypes

Code:
class Solution:
    # @param A : list of integers
     # @return an long
    def subarraySum(self, A):
        ans = 0
        for i in range(0,len(A)):
            contribution = A[i]*(i+1)*(len(A)-i)
            ans+=contribution
        
        return ans
