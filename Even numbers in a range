You are given an array A of length N and Q queries given by the 2D array B of size QÃ—2.
Each query consists of two integers B[i][0] and B[i][1].
For every query, your task is to find the count of even numbers in the range from A[B[i][0]] to A[B[i][1]]

Code:
class Solution:
    # @param A : list of integers
    # @param B : list of list of integers
    # @return a list of integers
    def solve(self, A, B):
        result =0
        psum= [0]*len(A)   # make prefix sum of count of even numbers
        if A[0]%2 ==0:
            psum[0]=1
        else:
            psum[0]= 0

        for i in range(1,len(A)):

            if A[i]%2==0:
                psum[i] = psum[i-1] + 1  
            else:
                psum[i] = psum[i-1]

        
        result_array = []
        for j in range(len(B)):
            l = B[j][0]
            r = B[j][1]
            
            result = 0
            
            if l ==0:
                result = psum[r]

            else:
                result = psum[r] - psum[l-1]

            result_array.append(result)

        return result_array
